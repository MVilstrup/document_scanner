This is a simple repository for getting started working with computer vision easily. 

Included are some small images, along with some small python scripts demonstrating the different functionality of OpenCV, Numpy etc.

To be able to show images and video on a mac, you might want to install XQUARTZ:
http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/

To test if the environment works correctly run the following commands in the terminal:
cd /vagrant/python
python load_display_save.py -i ../images/trex.png
